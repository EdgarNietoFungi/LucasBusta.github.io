	<p>As a graduate student in the lab of Prof. <a href="http://blogs.ubc.ca/jetterlab/">Reinhard Jetter</a>
	at the <a href="https://www.chem.ubc.ca/">The University of British Columbia</a>,
	I study plant surfaces. Above all, I am interested in the structure, biosynthesis, and 
	properties of phytochemicals. These remarkable compounds exhibit incredible structural
	and functional diversity and are important to the everyday life of both plants and humans!
	To learn more about phytochemicals and why they are so fascinating please visit my phytochemical <a href="http://">blog</a>

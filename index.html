	<p align="justify">As a graduate student in the lab of Prof. <a href="http://blogs.ubc.ca/jetterlab/" target="_blank">Reinhard Jetter</a>
	in the <a href="https://www.chem.ubc.ca/" target="_blank">The University of British Columbia dept. of Chemistry</a>,
	I study the chemical compounds that comprise plant surfaces. However, I am interested in the structure, biosynthesis, and 
	properties of all phytochemicals, the chemical compounds present in plants. These remarkable substances exhibit 
	incredible structural and functional diversity and play important roles in the everyday lives of both plants and humans!
	To learn more about phytochemicals and why they are so fascinating please visit my

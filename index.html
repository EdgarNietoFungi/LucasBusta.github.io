	<p align="justify">I am interested in the structure, biosynthesis, and properties of phytochemicals; chemical compounds present in plants. These remarkable substances exhibit incredible structural and functional diversity and play important roles in the everyday lives of both plants and humans. To learn more about phytochemicals and why they are so fascinating please visit my <a href="https://plantsarechemists.blogspot.ca/" target="_blank">phytochemistry blog</a>.</p>
	
	<p align="justify">I am currently a post doctoral research associate in the laboratory of <a href="http://www.unl.edu/cahoonlab/welcome" target="_blank">Edgar Cahoon</a> in the <a href="http://www.unl.edu/psi/" target="_blank">Center for Plant Science Innovation</a> at the <a href="http://www.unl.edu/" target="_blank">University of Nebraska - Lincoln</a>. I am studing specialty lipids in crop species that protect crops from pathogens and also act as anti-cancer and health-promoting compounds in humans.</p>
	
	<p align="justify">As a Ph.D. student in the lab of Prof. <a href="http://blogs.ubc.ca/jetterlab/" target="_blank">Reinhard Jetter</a> in the <a href="https://www.ubc.ca/" target="_blank">The University of British Columbia's</a> department of <a href="https://www.chem.ubc.ca/" target="_blank">Chemistry</a>, I studied the specialty wax lipids that cover plant surfaces. I combined organic and analytical chemistry to discover new compounds and learn about their biosynthesis.</p>

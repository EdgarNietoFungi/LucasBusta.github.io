	<p align="justify">As a graduate student in the lab of Prof. <a href="http://blogs.ubc.ca/jetterlab/" target="_blank">Reinhard Jetter</a> in the <a href="https://www.chem.ubc.ca/" target="_blank">The University of British Columbia department of Chemistry</a>, I study the chemical compounds that comprise plant surfaces. However, I am interested in the structure, biosynthesis, and properties of all phytochemicals, specialty chemical compounds present in plants. These remarkable substances exhibit incredible structural and functional diversity and play important roles in the everyday lives of both plants and humans! To learn more about phytochemicals and why they are so fascinating please visit my <a href="\blog">phytochemistry blog</a>.</p>
	<p align="justify">In 2017 I will be a post-doctoral researcher in the laboratory of <a href="http://www.unl.edu/cahoonlab/welcome" target="_blank">Edgar Cahoon</a> at the <a href="http://www.unl.edu/psi/" target="_blank">Center for Plant Science Innovation</a> at the <a href="http://www.unl.edu/" target="_blank">University of Nebraska - Lincoln</a>. There I will be studying the biosynthesis of specilaty plant lipids in crop species.</p>

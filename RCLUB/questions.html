	What are two ways to show the data for the first Quebec plant under nonchilled conditions?<br />
	What was the average uptake of nonchilled Quebec plants at a CO2 concentration of 500 ml/L?<br />
	On average, and at 500 ml/L CO2, did chilled or nonchilled plants absorb more CO2? What about chilled/nonchilled and Type?<br />
	Did these plants absorb more CO2 per unit CO2 concentration as CO2 concentration increased? Was there a difference in this phenomonon between Types? Treatments?

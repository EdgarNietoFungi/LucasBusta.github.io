				<td style="padding: 5px" align="justify" ><h3 align="center">Plant chemistry</h3>While many organisms use movement to respond to stresses, plants use chemistry. To do this, plants have developed complex metabolic networks that generate a massive diversity of chemical compounds, many of which are unique to plants (Figure 1; green pathways / compounds).  These chemicals are absolutely critical to human life; they provide us with food, fuel, and medicine. Currently, more than 15,000 species of plants are currently used by humans for medicine, more than 10,000 for materials, and 5,000 for food (<a href="#fn1" id="ref1">SOTWP 2016</a>). Known and unknown plant species still contain new molecules that can cure diseases, contribute to better nutrition, teach us how to make new or better synthetic materials, and provide us with the genetic tools to improve existing biotechnologies. <!--However, nearly 30% of plant species on earth are threatened with extinction. We are in a race against the clock to learn as much as we can about the amazing chemical compounds that plants have spent millions of years developing before they disappear.-->				</td>

				<td style="padding: 5px" align="justify" rowspan="2"><h3 align="center">Plant specialty lipid diversity and biosynthesis</h3>Plant lipid compounds are one subset of plant chemicals. They are made principally of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and are important industrial products, medicines, and foods. For example, rubber trees produce natural rubber that we use as an industrial polymer, foxglove plants produce a class of natural lipid compounds called digitalins that are used to treat heart disorders, and plants oils are ubiquitous in cooking. Since plant lipid compounds are all crucial to our daily lives, we need a fundamental understanding of how and why they are made, and which plants make them. By answering these questions, scientists are building a base of knowledge which can be used in the future to solve a huge diversity of problems we face. One of the goals of my research is to contribute to our understanding of how these compounds and made and what kind of properties they have.</td>

				<td style="padding: 5px" align="justify" rowspan="2"><h3 align="center">The plant cuticle</h3>One class of plant lipids are those that plants create to coat their large surface areas and protect themselves from getting dried out by the sun. These coatings are often superhydrophobic, causing water droplets to bead and roll off the plant, cleaning the surface as they do so (see the picture on the right). Plant epidermal cells coat themselves in cuin, a polyester matrix that serves as a molecular scaffold, and cuticular waxes, a mixture of very-long-chain lipids that accumulates within and on top of the cutin to seal the surface. In this way, the cuticle is a composite material like carbon fiber. Both the cutin and wax components of cuticular wax are essential to plant life on dry land and are therefore crucial areas of research as the climates that our crops must tolerate become increasingly variable. Different plant species seal their cuticule surfaces with different mixtures of wax compounds; some use fatty aldehydes, while others rely on alkanes or esters, and still others cover themselves with crystals made of secondary alcohols, ketones, or diketones. Why do plants do this? Presumably these modifications allow each plant's cuticle to perform optimally in local environmental conditions. One of the goals of my reaseach is to contributing to our understanding of how cuticular waxes affect the properties of the plant cuticle.</td>

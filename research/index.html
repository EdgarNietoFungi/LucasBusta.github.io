	<h3>The plant cuticle</h3>
	
	<p align="justify"> Plants have large surface areas to maximize their photosynthetic capacity
	but in doing so risk getting dried out by the sun. To hinder water loss, plants coat themselves 
	with a lipic layer called the cuticle. Two classes of phytochemicals, cutin and waxes, comprise this
	coating.

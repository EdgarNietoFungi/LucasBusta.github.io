	<p align="justify"> Plants have large surface areas to maximize their photosynthetic capacity
	but in doing so risk getting dried out by the sun. To hinder water loss, plants seal their above ground
	surfaces with a lipidic coating called the cuticle. Cuin, a polyester matrix, serves as a molecular scaffold
	within and on top of which cuticular waxes, a mixture of very-long-chain lipids, accumulate to seal the surface (Figure 1).
	Both these classes of phytochemicals are essential to plant life on dry land and are crucial areas of research as
	our planet becomes warmer. Fundamental advances in our understanding of the cuticle will inform
	agricultural practices and enable better crops.</p>

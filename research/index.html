	<h3>Plant chemistry</h3> 
	
	<p align="justify"> Plants can be seen as boring and are frequently taken for granted, however, they are absolutely critical to human life; they provide us with food, fuel, and medicine - and conjure these things out of thin air! Currently, more than 15,000 species of plants are currently used by humans for medicine, more than 10,000 for materials, and 5,000 for food. <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></p>
	
	<p align="justify">As sessile organisms plants have developed many chemical methods of responding to external stresses that other organisms may respond to with movement. To enable these chemical responses, plants have a highly advanced metabolic networks that provide them with access to a massive diversity of chemical compounds, many of which are not found elsewhere.  We have only begun to scratch the surface of the diversity and function of these compounds with our current research efforts.</p>
	
	<p align="justify"> To contribute to the advancement of our knowledge of plant metabolites and their uses, I research plant lipid compounds. In particular, I am interested in plant lipid diversity and the different means by which lipids are biosynthesized.

	<p align="justify"> Plant lipid compounds are important industrial products, medicines, and foods. For example, trees produce natural rubber that we use as a polymer, foxglove plants produce a class of natural lipid compounds called digitalins used to treat heart disorders, and that plant lipids are an essential source of food goes without saying. Since these compounds are all so fundamentally important to our daily lives, it makes sense to have a fundamental understanding of how, why, and which plants make them. By answering these questions, scientists are building a base of knowledge which can be used in the future to solve problems in all the areas in which these compounds are important.</p>

	<p align="justify"> Plants create large surface areas to maximize their photosynthetic capacity
	but in doing so risk getting dried out by the sun. To slow water loss, plants seal their above ground
	surfaces with a coating called the cuticle: a lipidic structure that protects plants from drying out. 
	
	These coatings are often superhydrophobic, causing water droplets to bead and roll 
	off the plant, cleaning the surface as they do so (Figure 2). Plant epidermal cells coat themselves in cuin, a polyester
	matrix that serves as a molecular scaffold, and cuticular waxes, a mixture of very-long-chain lipids that accumulates within
	and on top of
	the cutin to seal the surface (Figure 3). In this way, the cuticle is a composite material.
	Both the cutin and wax components of cuticular wax 
	are essential to plant life on dry land and are therefore crucial areas of research as the climates that our crops 
	must tolerate become increasingly variable.</p>

	<p align="justify"> Different plant species seal their cuticule surfaces with different mixtures of wax compounds; some use fatty aldehydes, while others rely on alkanes or esters, and still others cover themselves with crystals made of secondary alcohols, ketones, or diketones. Why do plants do this? Presumably these modifications allow each plant's cuticle to perform optimally in local environmental conditions. My reaseach is aimed at contributing to our understanding of how cuticular waxes affect the properties of the plant cuticle. </p>
	
	<p align="justify"> It will require input from researchers of multiple disciplines to understand how plant cuticles are optimized. So far, my contribution has been in the form of improving our understanding of cuticular wax diversity across the plant kingdom. In addition, I have contributed to our knowledge of the biosynthesis of branched wax compounds and wax compounds that bear secondary functional groups.

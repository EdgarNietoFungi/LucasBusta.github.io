	<p align="justify">Plants can be seen as boring and are frequently taken for granted, however, they are absolutely critical to human life; they provide us with food, fuel, and medicine - and conjure these things out of thin air! Currently, more than 15,000 species of plants are currently used by humans for medicine, more than 10,000 for materials, and 5,000 for food. <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></p>
	
	<p align="justify">As sessile organisms plants have developed many chemical methods of responding to external stresses that other organisms may respond to with movement. To enable these chemical responses, plants have a highly advanced metabolic networks that provide them with access to a massive diversity of chemical compounds, many of which are not found elsewhere.  We have only begun to scratch the surface of the diversity and function of these compounds with our current research efforts.</p>
	
	<p align="justify"> To contribute to the advancement of our knowledge of plant metabolites and their uses, I research plant lipid compounds. In particular, I am interested in plant lipid diversity and the different means by which lipids are biosynthesized.
	
	<h3>Plant specialty lipid diversity and biosynthesis</h3>

	<p align="justify"> Plant lipid compounds are important industrial products, medicines, and foods. For example, trees produce natural rubber that we use as a polymer, foxglove plants produce a class of natural lipid compounds called digitalins used to treat heart disorders, and that plant lipids are an essential source of food goes without saying. Since these compounds are all so fundamentally important to our daily lives, it makes sense to have a fundamental understanding of how, why, and which plants make them. By answering these questions, scientists are building a base of knowledge which can be used in the future to solve problems in all the areas in which these compounds are important.</p>
	
	
	<h3>The plant cuticle</h3>

	<p align="justify"> Plants create large surface areas to maximize their photosynthetic capacity
	but in doing so risk getting dried out by the sun. To slow water loss, plants seal their above ground
	surfaces with a coating called the cuticle: a lipidic structure that protects plants from drying out. 
	
	These coatings are often superhydrophobic, causing water droplets to bead and roll 
	off the plant, cleaning the surface as they do so (Figure 2). Plant epidermal cells coat themselves in cuin, a polyester
	matrix that serves as a molecular scaffold, and cuticular waxes, a mixture of very-long-chain lipids that accumulates within
	and on top of
	the cutin to seal the surface (Figure 3). Both the cutin and wax components of cuticular wax 
	are essential to plant life on dry land and are therefore crucial areas of research as the climates that our crops 
	must tolerate become increasingly variable.</p>

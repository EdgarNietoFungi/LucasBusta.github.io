	 <p style="text-align:justify">Many organisms use movement to survive harsh environments. Plants, however, are rooted in the groud and more often use chemistry to solve problems. Having done this for millions of years, plants have developed complex metabolic networks that generate a massive diversity of chemical compounds, many of which are only found in plants or even in particular plant lineages (Figure 1; green pathways / compounds).  These chemicals are absolutely critical to human life; they provide us with food, fuel, and medicine. Currently, more than 15,000 species of plants are currently used by humans for medicine, more than 10,000 for materials, and 5,000 for food (<a href="#fn1" id="ref1">SOTWP 2016</a>). Still, we have only scratched the surface of the vast pool of plant molecules that can cure diseases, contribute to better nutrition, teach us how to make new or better synthetic materials, and provide us with the genetic tools to improve existing biotechnologies.</p>

			<br>
			<img width=80% src="kernel.png" />
			<p>Natural waxes are a high value product used in diverse areas of industry. Essentially all the natural waxes used in the U.S. are imported from carnauba palm plantations. However, sorghum (milo) kernels are also coated in substantial amounts of wax and are emerging as a promising, domestic substitute for carnauba wax. I am currently investigating the following questions in this area. This project is supported by a fellowship from the National Science Foundation <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1812037&HistoricalAwards=false" target="_blank">Fellowship PRFB IOS-1812037</a>.</p>
			<p>Short-term questions: </p>
			<p> - What genes control the chemical profile of sorghum waxes?
			<p> - What genes control the abundance of waxes on sorghum kernels?
			<p>Long-term questions:
			<p> - What genetic elements confer kernel epidermis-enhanced expression to sorghum genes?</p>
			<p> - What are effective strategies for the engineering of sorghum wax amounts and composition?</p>

			<font size="+1"><b>The biosynthesis and evolution of biosynthetic pathways to fatty acid-derived natural products</b></font>
			<br>
			<img width=80% src="specialtylipids.jpg" />
			<p>Plants produce a massive array of chemicals to enhance their fitness. Relatively large efforts have been made to understand certain classes of these compounds, including phenolics, terpenoids, and alkaloids. By comparison, there has been almost no progress towards understanding fatty-acid derived natural products, even though more than 250 such compounds are already known, many of which have unique and potent bioactivites. I am currently focused on answering the following questions in this area:</p>
			<p>Short-term questions: </p>
			<p> - What is the biosynthetic pathway to falcarin-type polyacetylenes in <i>Daucus carota</i>?
			<p> - How do pathways to falcarin-type polyacetylenes vary among Apiales and Asterales species?
			<p>Long-term questions:
			<p> - What is the structural diversity of plant fatty acid natural products?</p>
			<p> - What is the genetic basis for these diverse structures?</p>

			<font size="+1"><b>The biogenesis of epicuticular wax blooms</b></font>
			<br>
			<img width=80% src="wax_blooms.JPG" />
			<p>Virtually all land plants coat themselves with waxes to protect against dehydration, but some plants go further and coat themselves in massive amounts of wax - enough that it is visible at a glance as a white coating. Though diverse plant lineages contain species that allocate carbon in this way, we have virtually no understanding of the function of these large investments of energy. I am currently focused on answering the following questions in this area:</p>
			<p>Short-term questions: </p>
			<p> - How does the chemical composition of wax blooms vary across the plant kingdom?
			<p> - What species have both wax blooms and available genetic resources?
			<p>Long-term questions:
			<p> - What molecular machinery is required for generating epicuticular wax blooms and how can such be engineered?</p>
			<p> - What are the biological functions of wax blooms?</p>

				<td style="padding: 5px" align="justify" rowspan="2"><h3 align="center">Plant specialty lipid diversity and biosynthesis</h3>Plant lipid compounds are one subset of plant chemicals. They are made principally of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and are important industrial products, medicines, and foods. For example, rubber trees produce natural rubber that we use as an industrial polymer, foxglove plants produce a class of natural lipid compounds called digitalins that are used to treat heart disorders, and plants oils are ubiquitous in cooking. Since plant lipid compounds are all crucial to our daily lives, we need a fundamental understanding of how and why they are made, and which plants make them. By answering these questions, scientists are building a base of knowledge which can be used in the future to solve a huge diversity of problems we face. One of the goals of my research is to contribute to our understanding of how these compounds and made and what kind of properties they have.</td>

				<td style="padding: 5px" align="justify" rowspan="2"><h3 align="center">The plant cuticle</h3>One class of plant lipids are those that plants create to coat their large surface areas and protect themselves from getting dried out by the sun. These coatings are often superhydrophobic, causing water droplets to bead and roll off the plant, cleaning the surface as they do so (see the picture on the right). Plant epidermal cells coat themselves in cuin, a polyester matrix that serves as a molecular scaffold, and cuticular waxes, a mixture of very-long-chain lipids that accumulates within and on top of the cutin to seal the surface. In this way, the cuticle is a composite material like carbon fiber. Both the cutin and wax components of cuticular wax are essential to plant life on dry land and are therefore crucial areas of research as the climates that our crops must tolerate become increasingly variable. Different plant species seal their cuticule surfaces with different mixtures of wax compounds; some use fatty aldehydes, while others rely on alkanes or esters, and still others cover themselves with crystals made of secondary alcohols, ketones, or diketones. Why do plants do this? Presumably these modifications allow each plant's cuticle to perform optimally in local environmental conditions. One of the goals of my reaseach is to contributing to our understanding of how cuticular waxes affect the properties of the plant cuticle.</td>

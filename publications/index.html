  	<p><b>Lucas Busta</b>, Jessica M. Budke, Reinhard Jetter. “<a href="http://aob.oxfordjournals.org/content/118/3/511.abstract">Cuticular wax coverage on <i>Funaria hygrometrica</i> is similar
	to vascular plants, but wax composition differs between surfaces of the leafy gametophyte, calyptra, and
	sporophyte capsule.</a>” ANNALS OF BOTANY, in press</p><p>TLC and GC-MS analysis were used to quantify wax coverage for the most time on a moss species. Wax composition is also reported and suggests that wax biosynthesis is optimized in each moss structure to meet specific environmental and developmental challenges.</p>

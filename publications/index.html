	<p>Pingtao Ding†, Dmitrij Rekhter†, Yuli Ding†, Kirstin Feussner, <b>Lucas Busta</b>, Sven Haroth, Shaohua Xu, Xin Li, Reinhard Jetter, Ivo Feussner, Yuelin Zhang. “Systemic Acquired Resistance Deficient 4 encodes a key enzyme for pipecolic acid biosynthesis.” THE PLANT CELL, in press</p>
	<!--<p>TLC and GC-MS analysis were used to quantify wax coverage for the most time on a moss species. Wax composition is also reported and suggests that wax biosynthesis is optimized in each moss structure to meet specific environmental and developmental challenges.</p>-->

							<p>Social media networks are now nearly impossible to ignore. For better or for worse, this is true even for scientists. The good news is that social media networks offer a variety of ways to advance scientific pursuits. They are powerful tools for communicating with non-scientists about the science we are doing. They are also tools for communicating with other scientists. On top of this, social networks can also be used to coordinate scientific projects in which the public can participate - <a href="citizen_science.html">citizen science</a>. Below are short descriptions of the ways I am currently using social media networks to further my scientific pursuits.

Relatively large efforts have been made to understand certain classes of these compounds, including phenolics, terpenoids, and alkaloids. By comparison, there has been almost no progress towards understanding fatty-acid derived natural products, even though more than 250 such compounds are already known, many of which have unique and potent bioactivites. I am currently focused on answering the following questions in this area:</p>

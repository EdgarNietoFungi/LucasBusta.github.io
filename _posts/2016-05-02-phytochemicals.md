<!-- Q: What do Agatha Christie, Adolf Hitler, and Erwin Schrödinger have in common?

A: In fiction or reality, they have all used cyanide as a poison!-->

<p align="justify"> As sessile organisms, many plants use chemical strategies to protect themselves from external attack, and poisoning attackers with cyanide is one of them! So far, more than 3000 species of plants have been identified that are capable of cyanogenesis.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> To do this, plants produce cyanide-containing compounds called cyanogens, for example, mandelonitrile (Figure 1). These cyanogens are inactive and generally not poisonous, so the plant cells can produce and store them in special compartments inside their cells without harming itself. In nearby but separate compartments, plants also store a special enzyme capable of transforming the inactive cyanogen into hydrogen cyanide. Then, when insects or other animals bite down on the leaves of the plant, the compartments' walls are crushed, mixing the cyanogen with the enzyme and releasing hydrogen cyanide right inside the attackers mouth!</p>

<p align="justify"> Plants produce and store cyanogens in many forms. Oftentimes they are stored linked with sugar molecules like glucose, in which case they are called cyanogenic glycosides (Figure 2). One of these, amygdalin, is found in the seeds of many fruits in the rose family, like apples, plums, apricots, and peaches, but only in relatively small amounts. In contrast, cassava root, a staple food in many[] countries contains substantial amounts of linamarin and lotaustralin. Accordingly, cassava root needs to be processed before consumption. One method of doing this is to grind the cassava, exposing the activating enzyme to linamarin and lotaustralin, and then mix it with water so it can be spread in a thin layer and allowed to dry. Once released, active hydrogen cyanide has a low boiling point, so much of it evaporates quickly and the cassava becomes safer to consume. </p>

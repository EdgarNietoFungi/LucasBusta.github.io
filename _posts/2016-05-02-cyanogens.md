<p align="justify">As sessile organisms, many plants use chemical strategies to protect themselves from external attack, and poisoning attackers with cyanide is one of them! So far, more than 3000 species of plants have been identified that are capable of cyanogenesis.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> To do this, plants produce cyanide-containing molecules called cyanogenic compounds, for example, mandelonitrile (Figure 1). Cyanogenic compounds (cyanogens) are inactive and generally not poisonous, so plants can produce and store them in special compartments inside their cells without causing harm. In nearby but separate compartments, plants also store a special enzyme capable of transforming the inactive cyanogenic compound into toxic hydrogen cyanide. Then, when insects or other animals bite down on the leaves of the plant, the compartments' walls are crushed, mixing the cyanogen with the enzyme and releasing hydrogen cyanide right inside the attackers mouth!</p>

<p align="justify">Plants produce and store cyanogens in many forms. Oftentimes they are stored linked with sugar molecules like glucose, in which case they are called cyanogenic glycosides (Figure 2). One of these, amygdalin, is found in the seeds of many fruits in the rose family, like apples, plums, apricots, and peaches, but only in relatively small amounts. In contrast, cassava root, a staple food in many African, Asian, and Latin American countries<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>, contains substantial amounts of linamarin and lotaustralin<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>. Accordingly, cassava root needs to be processed before consumption. One method of doing this is to grind the cassava, exposing the activating enzyme to linamarin and lotaustralin, and then mix it with water so it can be spread in a thin layer and allowed to dry. Once released, active hydrogen cyanide has a low boiling point, so much of it evaporates quickly and the cassava becomes safer to consume. Clearly, cyanogens are potent phytochemicals that allow the plant to protect itself from being consumed.</p>

<p align="justify">Plants unable to generate cyanogens are often more susceptible to attack than those that can. For example, approximately 25% of a wheat crop is lost to pests over the course of the agricultural process, with substantial losses occurring when the seeds are being stored prior to planting.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> To deal with this pesticides are often applied, but we are learning that pesticides often have detrimental effects to nearby water sources and can be difficult to control when washed away by rain. Materials chemists have recognized this problem and, inspired by cyanogens in nature, have invented a new coating that can replace pesticides in some applications. In the wheat storage example, seeds are coated with an enzyme, then a thin barrier, then a cyanogen.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> When the barrier is ruptured, the enzyme and cyanogen mix, releasing hydrogen cyanide. Overall, this makes the seeds less prone to attack during the pre-planting phase of the agricultural process. While this application is still in developmental phases and is undergoing testing to determine its effects on the nearby environment and ecosystem, it is a step towards the protection of crops with naturally occurring, biodegradable materials.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup></p>

<p align="justify">Not all plant attackers are affected negatively by cyanogens. Members of the moth species called "<i>Zygaena filipendulae</i>" are able to eat cyanogenic glucosides and then use them for their own defense. Cyanogenic glucosides they obtain in their diet and those that they produce internally are secreted in sticky droplets on their exteriors, deterring predatory birds (Figure 3).<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> This example demostrates that different species can develop similar strategies to protect themselves, a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_evolution" target="_blank">convergent evolution</a>, and that nature is a complex, interconnected system.</p>

<p align="justify"> This week the leaves of the tomato plants in our garden began to turn yellow (Fig. 1). Why is this? Leaves are normally green because of chlorophyll, the light-collecting compound that is highly abundant in most plant cells. So it seems possible that yellow leaves might mean the plant is losing its ability to produce chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is made of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and magnesium (Fig. 2). It seems unlikely that our tomatoes are suffering from a shortage of carbon, hydrogen, or oxygen, since they get these from the CO2 in the air and water we give them. Therefore it seems that a nitrogen or magnesium shortage could lead to leaf yellowing, and that our tomatoes may need these elements added to their soil. </p>

<p align="justify"> Nitrogen and magnesium are among six nutrients that plants need in substantial amount and are thus called macronutrients. Nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), and the metals potassium (K), calcium (Ca), sulfur (S), and magnesium (Mg) are all essential for plant health and are acquired through plant roots. Other metals are needed in very small amount and are called micronutrients, such as... </p>

<p align="justify">Not all metals are required for plant health, and some are even detrimental. For example, if aluminum, the most abundant metal in the earth's crust, can inhibit the absorption of magnesium and cause magnesium shortage. In soils with low acidity aluminum is not present in free form, but is bound up as Al(OH)3 and thus does not interfere with magnesium uptake. However, in acidic soils aluminum is present in ionic form (Al3+) and prevents magnesium uptake. Aluminum is toxic to plants that grow in acidic soils.</p>

<p align="justify"> Some plant species have evolved mechanisms to detoxify aluminum. Citric acid may be released from the roots and bind to the aluminum. [J.F. Ma, S. Hiradate, K. Nomoto, T. Iwashita, H. Matsumoto, Plant Physiol. 113 (1997) 1033â€“1039.] This complex may then be absorbed into the roots and transported up into areas of the plant where the aluminum will not interfere with the absorption of magnesium. In this way some plants are tolerant to aluminum.</p>

<p align="justify">Many of us are probably on a first name basis with the most common aluminum-tolerant plants - the Hydrangeas [this is only true of H. macrophylla]. Species in this genus have flowers that are normally red or pink because they contain a phytochemical called delphinidin (Fig. 3). When there is aluminum present in the soil the plant releases citric acid to bind the aluminum and then absorbs the bound aluminum and transports it to the flowers for storage. Here the aluminum interacts with the red delphinidin pigment and transforms it into a blue pigment, and causing the flowers to turn blue (Fig. 4). Thus, the flowers of the hydrangea, when present in acidic, aluminum-rich soils, turn from red to blue! </p>

<p align="justify">It is remarkable that ingredients as simple as aluminum and acid can cause such a dramatic change in flower color. It is even more amazing that this phenomenon is no accident but is a clever strategy used by the plant to prevent aluminum from interfering with magnesium uptake. Maybe someday tomato plants will also evolve this mechanism and prevent aluminum from inhibiting magnesium uptake, allowing them to thrive in a wider diversity of soils.</p>
